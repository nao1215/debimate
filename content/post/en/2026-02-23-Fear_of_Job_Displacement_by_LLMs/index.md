### Introduction

In 2026, LLM (Large Language Model) can develop almost anything I can imagine. This is terrifying. For example, Claude Code developed web scraping tool and apk(android package)/ipa(iOS package) parser in less than half a day. It used to take me over two weeks that develop same tools.

Coding skills are no longer as important as they used to be. This is good news for anyone who dreams of building something big. Aspiring entrepreneurs can now build PoC software faster than ever. However, ordinary software engineers like me may lose their jobs to LLMs. We need expertise in fields beyond coding to survive.

Until a few days ago, I believed the skills needed to survive were Quality Assurance and Security. Sadly, [Claude Code Security](https://claude.com/solutions/claude-code-security) was released shortly after. Security was not an impregnable fortress. Well, so much for my bullshit theory.

What the hell am I supposed to do?  
Drink whisky? (I can't even do that — my wife has forbidden it.)

### 30 Years Left in My Career

I am 35. In Japan, the retirement age is 65. So, I have to work for over 30 more years. For most of that time, I probably won't be writing code. So what will I be doing? I have no idea at this point. Now, LLMs collaborate with other LLMs. I am barely needed. In five years or so, this trend will only grow stronger.

I'll stop thinking about the bleak future. I can't picture it well anyway. Instead, I've decided to focus on creating more opportunities. So, I'll start learning English again and look into foreign companies.

### English is a powerful asset

When I was a college student around 2013, there was a common saying: "Engineers should learn English and Java." Back then, object-oriented programming was a buzzword among System Engineers, I think. 

Java may not be as popular in 2026, but English is still powerful. English is a ticket to working on the world stage. Japan may decline, but on a global scale, there will still be plenty of opportunities. I'll bet on it.

I will focus on improving my writing and speaking skills in 2026. This article was reviewed by Claude Code. I write in English, then Claude Code corrects it. Yea, I use LLM !!

### Foreign company's Japan office

I have no intention of changing jobs, but I looked into some foreign companies in Japan. I realized that design skills are also essential, not just English. By the way, why do foreign companies have so many interview rounds? I'm not a big fan of having too many interview rounds.

In any case, it seems difficult to switch to a foreign company with my current skills. I have a lot to learn.

### Final Thoughts

Life keeps getting harder. Seriously, living in modern Japan is tough. However, considering that David Neil Cutler, whom I deeply respect, is still working on the front lines well past 80, retiring at 65 seems too early. I should work until I die.

It took me several hours to write this article. I have a long way to go, but I'll take it one step at a time. By the way, I don't put much value on TOEIC. I might take the TOEIC once a year or so, but I'd rather focus on building practical skills.
